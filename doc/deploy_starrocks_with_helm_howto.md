# Deploy StarRocks With Helm

We have split the kube-starrocks chart into two subcharts: operator and starrocks since v1.8.0.

Installing kube-starrocks is equivalent to installing both operator and starrocks subcharts, and uninstalling
kube-starrocks is equivalent to uninstalling both operator and starrocks subcharts.

If you want more flexibility in managing your StarRocks clusters, you can install operator and starrocks subcharts
separately.

There are three charts in this repository:

```bash
$ helm repo add starrocks-community https://starrocks.github.io/starrocks-kubernetes-operator
$ helm repo update starrocks-community
$ helm search repo starrocks-community
