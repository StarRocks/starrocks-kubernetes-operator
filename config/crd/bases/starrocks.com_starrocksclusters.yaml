                                preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                or until the termination grace period is reached.

                            Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable

                            to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will

                            MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                            between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                            The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                            or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                            In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                            - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                            violate MaxSkew(1).
                            - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                            to topologies that satisfy it.
                            It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                        minDomains:
                          description: |-
                            MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.


                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew.


                            This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

                            We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                            of pods into each bucket.

                            nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                            e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
                            And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.

                            A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod

                            MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler

                                PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
                                API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
                                preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                or until the termination grace period is reached.

                          preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                          container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                          PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                          container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                          period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                          or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                or until the termination grace period is reached.

                            MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.


                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew.


                            This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

                            A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod

                      will fail if the pod can't start in 300 seconds. Your StartupProbeFailureSeconds is
                      the total time of seconds before startupProbe give up and fail the container start.
                      If startupProbeFailureSeconds can't be divided by defaultPeriodSeconds, the failureThreshold
                      will be rounded up.
                      Note: you can set it to 0 to disable the startup probe.

                            between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                            The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                            or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                            In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                            - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)

                            - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                            to topologies that satisfy it.

                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.


                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew.


                            This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

                            A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod

                            to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                            MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler

                        The reason why we do not support defaultMode is that we use hash.HashObject to

                        and if this MountInfo type has been changed, the volume name will be changed too, and
                        that will make pods restart.

                                The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                                a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.
                                Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                                If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                                value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                                Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via
                                the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down).
                                This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.
                                Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset.

                            MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                            between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                            The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                            or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                            In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                            - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                            violate MaxSkew(1).
                            - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                            to topologies that satisfy it.
                            It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                            MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.


                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew.

                      UpdateStrategy indicates the StatefulSetUpdateStrategy that will be
                      employed to update Pods in the StatefulSet when a revision is made to
                      Template. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#rolling-updates for more details.
                      Note: The maxUnavailable field is in Alpha stage and it is honored only by API servers that are running with the

                              The maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during the update.
                              Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).
                              Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up. This can not be 0.
                              Defaults to 1. This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the
                              MaxUnavailableStatefulSet feature. The field applies to all pods in the range 0 to
                              Replicas-1. That means if there is any unavailable pod in the range 0 to Replicas-1, it
                              will be counted towards MaxUnavailable.

                              Partition are updated. All pods from ordinal Partition-1 to 0 remain untouched.
                              This is helpful in being able to do a canary based deployment. The default value is 0.
