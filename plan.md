# StarRocks Kubernetes Operator Improvement Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive improvement plan for the StarRocks Kubernetes Operator project. The plan is organized by theme or area of the system, with each section describing the rationale for proposed changes and specific implementation suggestions. The improvements are prioritized based on their potential impact and implementation effort.

The StarRocks Kubernetes Operator is a Level 2 operator that automates the deployment and management of StarRocks clusters on Kubernetes. It currently supports deploying and managing Frontend (FE), Backend (BE), and Compute Node (CN) components, with features like automatic scaling, persistent volume mounting, and integration with other Kubernetes ecosystem components.

This improvement plan aims to enhance the operator's functionality, reliability, usability, and maintainability, making it more robust and user-friendly for both new and experienced users.
